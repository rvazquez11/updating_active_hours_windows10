# updating_active_hours_windows10
These 2 ps1 files are usded for powershell and will change the active hours times, which "SHOULD" stop your pc from automatically rebooting and restarting in windows 10 OS. The after hours file time setup is from 3pm till 8am. The other file time is set up from 7am till 4pm. Hope this helps others with the automatic reboots and updates.
